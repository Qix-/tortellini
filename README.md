The stupid - _and I mean really, really stupid_ - INI file reader and writer for C++11 and above. Calorie free (no dependencies)!

```c++
#include <tortellini.hh>

// (optional)
#include <fstream>

int main() {
	tortellini::ini ini;

	// (optional) Read INI in from a file.
	// Default construction and subsequent assignment is just fine, too.
	std::ifstream in("config.ini");
	in >> ini;

	// Retrieval
	//
	// All value retrievals must be done via the "default" operator
	// (the pipe operator).
	//
	// The right-hand-side type is what is returned. Anything other
	// than a string-like type causes a parse (see caveats section below).
	//
	// All keys are case-INsensitive. This includes section headers.
	std::string s          = ini["Section"]["key"] | "default string";
	int i                  = ini["Section"]["key"] | 42;    // default int
	long l                 = ini["Section"]["key"] | 42L;   // default long
	long long ll           = ini["Section"]["key"] | 42LL;  // default long long
	unsigned int u         = ini["Section"]["key"] | 42u;   // default unsigned int
	unsigned long ul       = ini["Section"]["key"] | 42UL;  // default unsigned long
	unsigned long long ull = ini["Section"]["key"] | 42ULL; // default unsigned long long
	float f                = ini["Section"]["key"] | 42.0f; // default float
	double d               = ini["Section"]["key"] | 42.0;  // default double
	long double ld         = ini["Section"]["key"] | 42.0L; // default long double
	bool b                 = ini["Section"]["key"] | true;  // default bool

	// Assignment
	//
	// (This example uses the same key, but of course
	// in reality this would just be overwriting the
	// same key over and over again - probably not
	// what you'd really want. I would hope I wouldn't
	// have to explain this, but you never know.)
	ini["New Section"]["new-key"] = "Noodles are tasty.";
	ini["New Section"]["new-key"] = 1234;
	ini["New Section"]["new-key"] = 1234u;
	ini["New Section"]["new-key"] = 1234L;
	ini["New Section"]["new-key"] = 1234UL;
	ini["New Section"]["new-key"] = 1234LL;
	ini["New Section"]["new-key"] = 1234ULL;
	ini["New Section"]["new-key"] = 1234.0f;
	ini["New Section"]["new-key"] = 1234.0;
	ini["New Section"]["new-key"] = 1234.0L;
	ini["New Section"]["new-key"] = true;

	// "Naked" section (top-most key/value pairs, before a section header)
	// denoted by empty string in section selector
	ini[""]["naked-key"] = "I'll be at the very top, without a section";

	// You can also iterate over all sections
	for (auto &pair : ini) {
		std::cout << pair.name << "\n"; // the name of the section
		int v = pair.section["some-key"] | 1234;
		std::cout << "some-key=" << v << "\n";
	}

	// (optional) Write INI to file.
	std::ofstream out("config.ini");
	out << ini;
}
```

# Things you should know.

This library has very few bells and whistles. It doesn't do anything fancy.

Here are the guarantees/features:

- Case-insensitive keys and section headers. Reading from a key/section with different cases will work fine, and writing to an existing section/key will preserve the casing.
- Untouched output (from using `stream << ini`) is guaranteed to be parsable (by using `stream >> ini`).
- Barring I/O issues or exceptions coming from the standard library, Tortellini will not throw or abort (see below section about "invalid data").
- _Pasta in, pasta out._ Source strings (from a parse) are preserved to the output. If you use `yes` instead of `true`, Tortellini will preserve that (unless the application overwrites the value).
- `yes`, `1` and `true` are all parsable as `bool(true)`. All other values equate to `false`. **NOTE:** This means that `ini[""]["b"] | true` will return `false`, _not_ `true`, if the key exists but is not a valid, parsable truth-ey value. This may be counter-intuitive for some users.
- All values are inherently string, and only parsed when retrieved.

Here are the caveats:

- **Do not store or share anything returned from the subscript operators (`[]`).** They return temporary objects that are meant for short-lived interactions. They are NOT lifetime safe and expect the underlying `tortellini::ini` instance to subsist beyond their own lifetimes.
- Invalid keys, values or section names skip the line entirely. This condition is henceforth referred to as "invalid data".
- Integer overflows when parsing are invalid data.
- Mismatched `]` for a `[` line is invalid data. Yes, keys _will_ bleed into the preceding section name. That's user error, not your application's. _Embrace it._
- Empty keys or empty values (excluding leading/trailing whitespace!) are "invalid data" in that they might be valid but not included in the resulting data and thus _won't_ be re-emitted.
- Empty sections (or sections with 100% invalid data as key/value pairs) are themselves invalid data and are not emitted.
- `[]` is a valid section name. It means the "naked" section. Re-emitting the INI will move those keys to the top regardless of where `[]` is positioned in the input file.
- No comments are supported; `;` is a valid (string) character.
- No caching or memoization; if you retrieve anything but a `std::string`, there _will_ be a parse. I never said Tortellini was hyper-over-optimized.

# Testing
You can test by running:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTING=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build .
ctest
```

# License

You have two choices in license. Pick whichever one you want.
Tortellini is uncucumbered. Go crazy. Eat some pasta.
